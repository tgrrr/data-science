families with children have 1.8 children

2716224*1.8 = 
> 4889203 children
= 4,889,203 children

~ 2716224 very roughly mothers who had 1.8 children

of which ~0.75 were employed


2716224 * .25 = 679056 
679056 ~ unemployed women

2716224 * .75 = 2037168
**2037168 ~ employed women**

# average time taken off for maternity
40 weeks (9 months) * 1.8 (children)
72 weeks (or 1.4 years, or 1 year 5 months) total average time taken off

average age of mothers 30.5 (up from 28)

$57,288 = average salary for an 25-35 year old

Then, around 50% back in employment:
Since the 1996 Census, the proportion of mothers who are active in the workforce has increased from 46.1 per cent to 53.4 per cent. Mothers are increasingly likely to be employers or self-employed, with this percentage rising from 3.9 per cent to 6.7 per cent in the last 20 years.

Average working life:
People only spend 328 days socializing with friends, on average, over the course of a lifetime. 
However, the average person spends 13 years and two months at work, according to one analysis from HuffPost Australia.

HOW MUCH TIME WILL YOU SPEND WORKING?
On average, people now spend approximately 13 years and two months of their lives at work. If you often put in overtime, you can factor in an additional year and two months. 
The average worker spends nearly a quarter of their time on the job during a typical 50-year stint of employment.

Less than half (46%) of younger mothers aged 15-24 had a job while they were pregnant. 
This was less than mothers in older age groups, with almost three quarters (74%) of mothers aged 30-39 having a job while pregnant.
Over one quarter (29%) of mothers who had a job during their pregnancy permanently left their job either before or after the birth of the child. 
Almost half (49%) of these women left their job specifically to care for their child, while 11% left as it was a temporary job or employment.
