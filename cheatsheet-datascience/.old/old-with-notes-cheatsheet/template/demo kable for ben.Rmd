This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library("knitr")
library("kableExtra")
```

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, warnings=0}
# Setup kable to be used with 
# {r table_format, results = "hide", table = T, eval = F}
  default_source_hook <- knit_hooks$get('source')
  knit_hooks$set(
    source = function(x, options) {
      if(is.null(options$table))
        default_source_hook(x, options)
      else {
        eval(parse(text = x)) %>%
          kable("html") %>%
            kable_styling("hover", full_width = F)
      }  
    }
  )
```



# ```{r table_format, results = "hide", table = T, eval = F, include= T}
```{r table_format,  table = T}
# This is kabled
plot(cars)
head(cars)
```

```{r}
measuresOfSimularity <- function(param, param2, similarityType, ...) {
# do something  
}

```

```{r doThis="Russel-rao" plotXLabel='foo' yLabel="bar", caption='bar'}
# this isn\'t
measuresOfSimularity(cars)

head(cars)



```






Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
