6. Sampling distribution
- stats week 6

Goals:
- Describe the purpose of sampling for estimation and inference.
- Define and distinguish between different sampling methods.
- Define a sampling distribution for a statistic.
- Define the expected value and variance of a sampling distribution.
- Use technology to simulate and explore the characteristics of sampling distributions.
- Define and apply the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

tl;dr
Common probability-based methods include
- simple random sampling - every unit in a population has an equal chance of being selected
- cluster sampling - Divides the population into naturally occurring and homogeneous clusters, e.g. postcodes, towns, manufacturing batches, factories, etc.
- stratified sampling.

Non-probability based methods make no effort to ensure the sample is randomly representative.
- convenience sampling,
- purposive sampling,
- quota sampling and
- snowballing.
