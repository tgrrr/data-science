confidence interval is:
How confident that we are that if we re-sampled the population, we would get same results

confidence level vs confidence intervals

CI or Confidence Level is normally 95%



## tl;dr:

```{r}
favstats(~IQ, data = IQ)

confint(
  t.test(
    ~IQ,
    data = IQ
  )
)
```
## if sigma is known

- Providing interval is better than point
- There is confidence level and confidence impact

## t and z tables
- Sometimes we use z or t tables
- t table - if we know it follows a normal distribution
- z table - if sample size is greater than 30

```{r}
qnorm()
```

## if we don't know sigma

qt formula (rather than qnormal)

qt(.)


t
- assumption of normality
- and sample size is less than 25



Proportions

p = proportions

p(1 - p)
________
   n

? can we use normal approximation   
   
np(1 = p)

if this >= 5, then we






```{r}


```
