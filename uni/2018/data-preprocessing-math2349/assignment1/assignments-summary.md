1. Locate an open source of data from the web.
- one numeric variable.
- one qualitative (categorical) variable.
(both an X and Y axis variable), more if you're clever.

S2. Summarise the data to tell an interesting and compelling story using a statistical plot.

P3. Inspect the data frame and variables using R functions. As a minimum, you should:
- check the dimensions of the data frame.
- check the data types (i.e., character, numeric, integer, factor, and logical) of the variables in the data set.
- check the levels of factor variables, rename/rearrange them if required.
- check the column names in the data frame, rename them if required.

P4. Subset the data frame using first 10 observations (include all variables). Then convert it to a matrix. If you get an error, explain why you got this error.

P5. Subset the data frame including only first and the last variable in the data set, save it as an R object file (.RData).

Use Plotly to bring your data to life (see some great examples in the Google+ Community) - see the tutorial here to help get started.
Use annotations within the plot to help tell your story and highlight important points.
Write a brief caption summary to help explain the plot and the compelling story within (200 words max). The summary should provide a link to the data source.
Submit a PDF file of your plot, your 200 word summary and a link to an interactive public version of your Plotly graph to the Assignment 1 Submission link on Blackboard. Place the summary and Plotly link in the assignment comments section.

Plotting Competition Marking Rubric

Level of Achievement
Description
0 (No submission)
No plot submitted.
1 - 2 (Poor)
Inappropriate plot type for data, plot not based on real data or only one variable considered.
3 - 4 (Needs improvement)
A plot was submitted, but major issues were present. For example:
	•	Axes not labelled correctly
	•	The nature of the plot variables are unknown
	•	The plot is missing important elements such as labels and legends.
	•	The plot is overcrowded or poorly scalled
	•	The plot is difficult to interpret or make sense of
	•	Categorical variable treated as continuous or vice versa.
5 - 6 (Acceptable)
Appropriate plot presented of a least two variables, but multiple minor  issues are present. For example:
	•	No data source cited
	•	No apparent attempt to present a compelling story
	•	Not anchoring the y-axis at 0 distorts the effect
	•	Dual axis plot used instead of scatter plot
	•	Non-standardised scales used for comparison (frequencies used instead of risk estimates adjusting for population size)
	•	Labels and captions not detailed enough to assist with interpretation.
7 - 8(Good)
A well presented and interpretable plot of at least two variables. However, the story is not compelling or no annotations or comments are made to highlight the plot’s appeal. Some minor presentation issues might be present.
9 - 10 (Excellent)
A well presented, interpretable plot that tells a compelling story using data.
