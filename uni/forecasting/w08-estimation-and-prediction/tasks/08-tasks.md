Module 8: Tasks
Estimation and Prediction

The aims of the tasks given here are to

    improve R skills in the application of state-space models,
    practice choosing the suitable estimation method for state-space models, and
    practice use of the Monte Carlo approach to generate confidence intervals for forecasts.

Working individually or in small groups, please complete the following exercises.

1. In this task, we will revisit the mean monthly median aerosol optical depth series at Cape Grim between 1986 and 2014 given in aerosol.csv Preview the documentfile (http://goo.gl/Ra4tXA). Load the aerosol series into R and do the following tasks

    Display the series using suitable descriptive plots and draw inferences about the mechanism behind the series.
    Considering the structure of the series, fit suitable state-space models to this data using at least two different estimation approaches.
    Select the best model for this series considering the goodness-of-fit measures and the results of diagnostic checks.

2. Using the best models you identified in the first task, do the following tasks

    Find simulation distributions and intervals and visualise the results for 1000 simulated sample paths.
    Display the 5% and 95% limits of the confidence interval and mean and median level for the predictions.
