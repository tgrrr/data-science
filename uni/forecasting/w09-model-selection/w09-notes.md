Module 9: Introduction
Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 9: Selection of the most suitable model from a set of tentative models is important in terms of getting precise forecasts. This week, we will focus on model selection for the state space models. Then, we will go on with a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of the model selection and improve your skillsets for the implementation of the methods.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyse past patterns in time series data and develop appropriate models for forecasting;
2. Estimate forecasting models using R software
3. Apply methods of forecasting to practical problems including assessing forecast accuracy and criticising the results to enhance forecasting performance;
4. Demonstrate practical experience by having been exposed to problems based on real data
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to begin work on the Final project.
