# Module 9: Tasks
# Model Selection
# The aims of the tasks given here are to
# 
# improve R skills in the application of model selection procedures models,
# practice choosing the suitable model and model selection procedure for state-space models, and
# practice building up a small-scale expert system.
# Working individually or in small groups, please complete the following task.
# 
# We will focus on the unemployment rate series in this task. We will consider the monthly unemployment rate series of AustriaPreview the document (source (Links to an external site.)), AustraliaPreview the document (source) (Links to an external site.), CanadaPreview the document (source) (Links to an external site.), United StatesPreview the document (source) (Links to an external site.), JapanPreview the document (source) (Links to an external site.), and United KingdomPreview the document (source) (Links to an external site.) between January 1995 and May 2017. Your main aim is to find the state-space model that can be used to fit the monthly unemployment rate series in general. Load the all series into R and do the following tasks
# 
# Display the series using suitable descriptive plots and draw inferences about the mechanism behind the series.
# Apply suitable decompositions and draw inferences about the structure of seasonality.
# Specify a bunch of tentative models to feed into the model selection procedures.
# Apply ICs and prediction validation procedures to find a suitable model for unemployment rate series.
# Compare the procedures with each other using the measures based on MASE.
