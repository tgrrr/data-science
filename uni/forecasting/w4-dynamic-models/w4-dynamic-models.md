Module 4: Introduction
Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 4: After learning the distributed lag models, we will go on with dynamic models. Also, we will focus on prewhitening and spurious correlation. We will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of dynamic models, prewhitening and spurious correlation and improve your skillsets for the implementation of these methods.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyse past patterns in time series data and develop appropriate models for forecasting
2. Estimate forecasting models using R software
3. Apply methods of forecasting to practical problems including assessing forecast accuracy and criticising the results to enhance forecasting performance
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to work on Assignment 1 and 2, the Final Project and Mid-Semester test.
