# Problems to solve Forecasting group ass3

## Rubric:

### Reporting 20%

- [ ] Inference clearly addressed by relevant output
- [ ] Inferences in **relevant sections**

  Sections:

  - [ ] Data
    - [x] Data Description (move from introduction) - In each month/year/quart

  - [ ] Preprocessing/Cleaning (currently called Data preparation)
    - [ ] Expand on preprocessing
    - [ ] Include code
    - [ ] Transformation

<!-- FIXME: -->
  - [-] Model
    - [ ] Parameter Estimation (formerly literature review)
    - [ ] Expand

  - [?] Model Fitting Section

  - [ ] Analysis / Results
    - [ ] Create this
    - [ ] Get results from Conclusion
    - [ ] ? Tables

  - [ ] Conclusion / Discussion
    - [ ] References Bibleography
    - [ ] Appendix


- [ ] All bits of output are used for inference
- [ ] No missing sections


### Descriptive Analysis (10%)

- [-] Uses all suitable plots (partial)
  - [ ] Plots are interpreted
  - [ ] Interpreted in a way to show understanding of concept targeted by the statistics/plot

- [-] Descriptive statistics are displayed (partial)
  - [ ] Descriptive Statistics are interpreted
  - [ ] Interpreted in a way to show understanding of concept targeted by the statistics/plot

# ### Choice of Viable Model (15%)
#
# - [x] Suitable model is chosen
# - [ ] Show all variables are suitable for the aim of analysis
# - [ ] Insightful reasons given about selection of the model
#
# ### Implementation of models (15%)
#
# - [x] All possible models are fitted
# - [ ] Output: All the relevant outputs are clearly interpreted in a way to inform the next step of the analysis
#
# ### Diagnostics Checking (15%)
#
# - [ ] Diagnostics checking are applied
# - [ ] Assumptions of applied approaches are validated
# - [ ] Mature discussion of diagnostics checking is given
