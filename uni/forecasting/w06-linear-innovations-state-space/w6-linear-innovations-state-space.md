# Module 6 - Linear Innovations State Space Models

Notes:

Intuition of dampening, will drop the forecast

TODO: Walked into class at p29 (innovations state space model)

## Introduction

In this module, we will study linear innovations state space models.  Then, we will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding and improve your skillsets for the implementation of these models.

This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyse past patterns in time series data and develop appropriate models for forecasting;
2. Estimate forecasting models using R software
3. Apply methods of forecasting to practical problems including assessing forecast accuracy and criticising the results to enhance forecasting performance;
4. Demonstrate practical experience by having been exposed to problems based on real data
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to work on Assignment 2 and Final Project.


### Includes:

- the general linear innovations state-space model
- a simple algorithm for computing the one-step prediction errors (or innovations)
- the properties of the models, including stationarity and stability
- some basic innovations state-space models
- variations of the basic innovations state-space models
