# Module 1: Introduction




---

## Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 1: You will study basic context of time series and stochastic processes including basic visualisations for time series data. Then, you will be given a number of tasks to be completed in hands-on tasks session.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyse past patterns in time series data and develop appropriate models for forecasting
4. Demonstrate practical experience by having been exposed to problems based on real data
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to begin work on Assignment 1 and the Final Project.

Week-1 Welcome
No unread replies. No replies.
Dear All,

Welcome to the first week of the Forecasting course. This semester, I'm coordinating this course and we have two lecturers Dr Batoul Abd El Aziz and Mr Armin Pourkhanali teaching the course. Batoul has a PhD degree from Sorbonne University, France, and Armin is about to complete his PhD at Monash University. Short biographies of lecturers are available in the Teaching Team page of Canvas shell.

This week, we’ll start with a detailed introduction of the course contents, hands-on tasks, assessment tasks, discussion board, and feedback channels. Most of the learning resources have been published on the Canvas shell of the course. In each week, we will cover a module and apply the contents over real data sets in hands-on task sessions. Please have a look at the Canvas shell before the first class.

After the introduction, we will focus on some essential subjects in time series analysis and forecasting. We will see some basic theoretical aspects in the first week’s class as well. After your lecturer's presentation, you will be working on real datasets individually or in groups. The lecturers and tutors will guide you through practical applications. Because we will be working on R, you need to bring along a fully charged laptop that is able to run RStudio and the packages listed below:

                  forecast, dLagM,  TSA, expsmooth, Hmisc, x12, car, AER, and dynlm.

Please make sure that these packages have been installed on the devices that you’ll use during the semester before the first class. If you have any difficulty in installation, please share your questions over the discussion board available in the Canvas shell of the course.

I have the following points to announce:

Course Information is available under the Canvas shell of our course. You can find further information about how we will proceed during the semester on this information page. 
Online Module 1 was finalized and available via the Canvas shell.
PDF versions of Module 1 and the first week’s presentation are available via the Canvas shell.
The locations of the parallel classes are 080.10.017 and 070.03.004 and time is Wednesdays between 5:30-8:30 pm.
The lecturers will record the classes and publish through the EchoCenter in the Canvas shell.
The free e-book version of the prescribed textbook (Links to an external site.) is available in the collection of RMIT Library. So, you should log in to library search to see the full text of e-book version. There will also be printed copies of the textbook available in the library.
The points that I would like you to ensure that you have

read the course guide of the course (Links to an external site.),
not been enrolled another course that is clashing with MATH1307,
done the prerequisite course “MATH1324 Introduction to Statistics.”
To get organised for Week 1 and locate classes, please refer to myRMIT (Links to an external site.) and myTimetable. (Links to an external site.)
If you haven’t completed MATH1324 Introduction to Statistics or you are not proficient with R, please enroll again in another semester. R is the main venue for the application of methods covered in the course and unfortunately, I do not have enough time to teach basics of R. The course where you can build up your basic R skills is MATH1324 Introduction to Statistics.

If you have enrolled the course and unable to see the course in your time table, don’t worry about it. Timetabling system is hooked up the room capacity and does not count for the students enrolled after the room capacity filled up. Your enrollment in this course should be alright if you are getting this email.

I will keep posting an announcement each Monday to inform you about the focus of the coming class and the related activities.

I wish you a fabulous semester. Looking forward to seeing you in the class.

Cheers,

Haydar
