# Module 5: Exponential Smoothing

# Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 5: We will focus on the exponential smoothing models including simple, Holt's, Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing and we will start working with state space models. We will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of the exponential smoothing models and state space models and improve your skillsets for the implementation of these methods.

## This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyse past patterns in time series data and develop appropriate models for forecasting
2. Estimate forecasting models using R software
3. Apply methods of forecasting to practical problems including assessing forecast accuracy and criticising the results to enhance forecasting performance
Demonstrate practical experience by having been exposed to problems based on real data

## Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to begin work on Assignment 2, the Final Project, and Mid-Semester test.
