Cascading models

Underlying assumptions:

- Activated = If nodes can receive information
    - Can activate neighbouring node
    Node can only influence connected nodes
    Decisions are binary (activated/not activated)
    Notes can change to active, but not in reverse

- Independent Cascade Model (ICM)
  Sender-centric model
  Each node has one chance to activate neighbour
  Active nodes = senders
  Being activated = receivers
  (not same as linear threshold model, which concentrates on receivers)

Week 9: Introduction 1
Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 9!

In this week, we learn about one of the canonical tools in network sciences/social network analysis - community detection.

 

Links to the learning objectives
This module will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

Apply data science to analyse social media and social networks 
Analyse social networks by finding communities, identifying important nodes, and influence propagation.
Describe the theoretical concepts behind the social media and network analytical approaches
 

Purpose
Community detection is an essential tool of anyone working on social networks (or graphs for that matter).  This week we'll get an introduction to it, and provide enough initial ideas that you'll be able to pick up any other techniques for community detection - I am aware there many be a few hundred algorithms, and there could possibly be more.
