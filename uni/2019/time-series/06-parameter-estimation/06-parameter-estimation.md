# Module 6: Introduction

## Introduction to the week
**Welcome to Week 6:** Actually there are two sets of parameters to be specified or estimated.

The first set of parameters include the orders of the model, specification of which explained in the previous module. The second set of parameters includes those to be estimated using data. There are several estimation methods for this estimation tasks. Each method has its own drawbacks and superior to each other under certain circumstances. We will discuss these cases and methods in detail in this module. Then, we will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of parameter estimation of ARIMA models and improve your skillsets for the implementation of time series analysis methods.

This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

3. Estimate model parameters and compare different models developed for the same dataset in terms of their estimation and prediction accuracy

## Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to work on Assignment 2 and Final Project.
