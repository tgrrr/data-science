# Module 2: 

## Notes:

`Decomposition`

`type='additive' OR type='multiplicative'`

X-12 package

T/F on considering seasonality

Y<sub>t</sub> - S = Something + Res

Y = S + T + R
Y  = Seasonality + Trend + Residual
Y = S + T + R

What is SI ratio?

## Introduction

Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 2: We will study basic operations and decompositions for the analysis of time series data. We will also cover how to do forecasting after applying decompositions. We will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of basic operations and decompositions and improve your skillsets for the implementation of these methods.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyse past patterns in time series data and develop appropriate models for forecasting
2. Estimate forecasting models using R software
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to complete the analyses required for Assignment 1, the Final Project and Mid-Semester test.
