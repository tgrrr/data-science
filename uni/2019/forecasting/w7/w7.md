Check heteroscedastic
- based on that choose multiplicative/additive


Welcome to Week 7: We will focus on `nonlinear and heteroscedastic` innovations state space models in this module. Then, we will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding and improve your skillsets for the implementation of these models.

This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Analyse past patterns in time series data and develop appropriate models for forecasting;
2. Estimate forecasting models using R software
3. Apply methods of forecasting to practical problems including assessing forecast accuracy and criticising the results to enhance forecasting performance;
4. Demonstrate practical experience by having been exposed to problems based on real data
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to work on Assignment 2 and Final Project.
