Call

lm(formula = foot_length ~ hand_length, data = Hand_length)

Get Estimated

(intercept)  88.87 = alpha
hand_length  0.8979 = b slope

feet_length = alpha (intercept) + hand_length * hand_length

y = alpha + X x B


Get R squared.
31.79 of variaion is feet length is a direct result of hand length


Look at sign of B slope.
If negative, then 

= 
= negative squared root

if > 75%, or r squared > ~.66


_____________________________________________________

H0 - there is no relationship between y and x
H: there is a relationship between y and x

_______________________

H0: check if alpha is 0 or not
H : if B is null or not <- more important

If P vale is very small
We reject the null hypothesis
Therefore the slope is significant

F value: (degrees of freedom)

rejection region probability ( F > 53.59)
P of F test
df ()




F is testing the significance of the line to the data

T test is testing the individual variable






```{r}
