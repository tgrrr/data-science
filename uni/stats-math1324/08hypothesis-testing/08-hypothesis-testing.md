#### What's included:

- Explain the process and logic of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST).
- Define one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis testing.
- State and test the assumptions behind the different tt-tests.
- Determine when a one-sample tt-test should be applied.
- Use technology to compute and interpret a one-sample tt-test.
- Identify and distinguish between the two-sample and paired sample research designs for continuous variables.
- Use technology to compute a two-sample (independent samples) tt-test and paired-samples (dependent samples) tt-test.
- Interpret a two-sample and paired-samples tt-test.

H<sub>0</sub> : - null hypothesis
H<sub>a</sub> : - alternative

## Null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>)

- H<sub>0</sub>: State an assumption about the world
- That is bleak and uninteresting. It's the status quo. Nothing is happening.
- H<sub>0</sub>: µ > µ0
- Eg. The population mean IQ score is 100.


## Alternate hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>

- H<sub>a</sub> contradicts and rejects H<sub>0</sub>
- Next, we state an opposing viewpoint that contradicts H0
- eg. The population mean IQ scores are not 100
- To support HA we must rule out H0 beyond a reasonable doubt


#### One sided test

- H<sub>0</sub>: µ > µ0
- H<sub>0</sub>: (mean) > (mean)0

*or*

#### Two sided test
H<sub>a</sub> : : µ ≠ µ0

## P value

P-value = p = Pr(x̄ < 36.81|μ = 37)

pt(t,df=n-1)

`P-value = p = Pr(t < 5.83|t = 0) + Pr(t > 5.83|t = 0)`

If P is very small
We reject H0, and HA is significant


#### Terms
- ɑ significance
- µ mean
- P proportion
