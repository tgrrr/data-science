This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}


library(readr) # Useful for importing data
library("tidyr")
library("miceadds", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library")
library("plotly")
```

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
family_violence <- read_csv("~/code/tldr/data-science/data-preprocessing-math2349/assignment1/family_violence.csv")


df %>%
  gather(key, value, -Gender, -`Age Range`)
#  extract(key, c("Year", "X1"), "(2.\\..)\\.(.)") %>%
#  spread(Year, value)


family_violence %>%
  gather(
    `2013-14`,
    `2014-15`,
    key = "Year",  
    value = "Cases" 
  ) ->family_violence
head(family_violence)

reshape(family_violence, 
        idvar = c(family_violence$`2012-13`, 
                  family_violence$`2013-14`,
                  family_violence$`2014-15`,
                  family_violence$`2015-16`, 
                  family_violence$`2016-17`), 
        direction="long",
        varying=c("Year", "Value"),
        v.names = c("Year", "Value") )


```

```{r}

write.csv(family_violence, file = "family_violence_tidy.csv")
getwd
    
#table4a %>%

?gather

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
