# Binomial distribution
- stats week4

Despite the omnipresence of variability, many variables follow predicable patterns. Thatâ€™s not to say we can reliably predict an individual observation with great certainty, but over the course of many repeated observations of a variable, we can predict many informative outcomes. Module 4 will introduce common probability distributions that are used to model different types of random variables.This module introduces two discrete probability distributions and one continuous probability distribution which are know to model the behaviour of many random processes.

 We will focus on using R to apply these probability distributions to different examples. We will build a conceptual understanding of what these probability distributions are used for and how they are applied in statistics.

In Week 4, we will work through the Binomial distribution. The Poisson and Normal distribution will be covered in Week 5.

Links to the learning objectives
The learning objectives associated with this module are:

## Goals:
Define and distinguish between random variables, discrete random variables, and continuous random variables.
Define the properties of the Binomial and Poisson distributions.
Correctly apply and work with the Binomial and Poisson distributions to solve Binomial and Poisson-based problems.
Define the properties of the normal distribution and identify where it can be applied.
Work with the normal distribution to solve normal-based problems.
Define the standard normal zz-distribution.
Standardise random variables to standard normal variables, and vice-versa.
Compare empirical distributions to theoretical probability distributions
