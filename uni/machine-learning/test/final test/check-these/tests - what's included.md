# Assessments & Samples
## Information on the Mid-Semester Test and the Final Exam
 The mid-semester test is 25% of your course grade and the final exam is 50%.
 
For the mid-semester test and the final exam, at least 50% of the questions will be loosely based on the exercise problems in the textbook that are listed below as "Mid-Semester Test Contents" and "Final Exam Contents" respectively for the mid-semester test and the final exam.
Remaining points will be allocated to True/False questions, fill in the blanks, multiple-choice questions, or relatively simple numerical questions (there will not be heavy computational work).
In order to help you study for the test and the exam, we posted some suggested solutions for starred chapter exercises, which can be accessed via the Course Resources module. The book's website contains additional freely available solutions whose link is also available in the Course Resources module.
Both for the mid-semester test and the final exam, you can only bring one A4-sized cheat sheet (hand-written or whatever) and you can write on both sides on your cheat sheet. No books or notes other than the cheat sheet will be allowed.
Please also make sure you bring a non-text storing calculator for both the mid-semester test and the final exam. 
There will be no specific questions on Python coding on neither the test or the final exam. That is, you will not be asked how to write a particular piece of Python code. On the other hand, you might be asked to interpret and/ or comment on Python code output.
Other than writing Python code, tutorials are integral part of the course and their content is a fair game in the test as well as the final exam.
You can find these assessments' date & times in the Assignments module.
