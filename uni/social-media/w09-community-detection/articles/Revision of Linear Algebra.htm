<p>This material provides the bare definitions, and some simple
examples. As you are using these notes to <i>revise</i>
your linear algebra, you will hopefully recall that there are
important geometric interpretations for these concepts, as well.
</p>
<a name="vector">
<h3>Vectors</h3>

<p>A <i>vector</i> over the real numbers may be viewed as
a sequence of real numbers. The <i>dimension</i> of the vector is the
number of real numbers in the sequence. So (3.2, 4.7, –2.4, 0.0) is
a vector of dimension 4. The 4 numbers in the sequence are referred
to as the <i>components</i> of the vector.</p>

<p>
An ordered number-sequence like this is also referred to as a <i>tuple</i>.
If the dimension (number of components) of the sequence is <i>n</i>, then
the tuple is an <i>n</i>-tuple. 2-tuples are usually called <i>ordered pairs</i>,
and 3-tuples are called <i>ordered triples</i>.
</p>

<p>Vectors can be added together by adding the corresponding components.
Thus (2, 7, 4, 0) + (1, 3, 5, 9) = (2+1, 7+3, 4+5, 0+9) = (3, 10, 9, 9).
A vector can also be multiplied by a real number (sometimes called a
<i>scalar</i>) by multiplying each component of the vector by the real
number. So 3×(2, 7, 4, 0) = (3×2, 3×7, 3×4, 3×0) 
= (6, 21, 12, 0).
</p>

<font size="-1">
<p>There is no particular reason why the components have to be <i>real
numbers</i>. In some applications (but probably not in the neural networks
course for which these revision notes were written) the components might
be <i>complex numbers</i>, or members of a <i>finite field</i> such as
the whole numbers with arithmetic done modulo <i>p</i>, where <i>p</i>
is a prime number.</p>
</font>

<p>It is often useful to work with vectors whose components are symbols
representing numbers (pro-numerals). Thus
(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>4</sub>)
is a vector of symbols. Sometimes it is convenient to use a symbol to refer
to a whole vector - a pro-vector, if you like. Often bold face symbols are
used for this purpose. So we might write <b>x</b> = 
(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>4</sub>),
or <b>y</b> =
(<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>4</sub>).
</p>

</a><a name="geometrical">
<h3>Geometrical Interpretation</h3>
<p>
With vectors that have 2 or 3 components, it is fairly easy to see how to
interpret the vectors as points in space. For example, the ordered
pair (–1, 1) is interpreted as a point in 2-dimensional
space (<i>xy</i>-space) with <i>x</i>–
and <i>y</i>–coordinates –1 and 1, respectively, as shown
in the diagram below. The vector is thought of as the line joining the
<i>origin</i> (the point (0, 0)) to the point (–1, 1).
Similarly, 3-tuples can be drawn as points in 3-dimensional
space (<i>xyz</i>-space).
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./Revision of Linear Algebra_files/2-vectors.png" alt="two vectors at right angles">
</p>
<p>
All of this works in dimensions &#8805; 4, but obviously is harder to visualise.
</p>

</a><a name="innerproduct">
<h3>Inner Products</h3>
<p>
The <i>inner product</i> (sometimes also called the <i>dot product</i>) of two
vectors with the same number of components is obtained by multiplying
together the corresponding
components and adding up the products. The inner product of vectors <b>x</b>
and <b>y</b> is written <b>x</b>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<b>y</b>, hence the alternative name dot-product.</p>

<p>So (1, 2, 3, 4) • (5, 6, 7, 8) = 1×5 + 2×6 + 3×7 + 4×8
= 5 + 12 + 21 + 32 = 70.<br>
As a symbolic example, <b>x</b> • <b>y</b> =
(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>4</sub>) .
(<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>4</sub>) =
<i>x</i><sub>1</sub><i>y</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>x</i><sub>2</sub><i>y</i><sub>2</sub> +
<i>x</i><sub>3</sub><i>y</i><sub>3</sub> + <i>x</i><sub>4</sub><i>y</i><sub>4</sub><br> 
</p>

<p>Two vectors are said to be <i>orthogonal</i> if their inner product is 0. For example
(1, 1, 1, 1) • (1, –1, 1, –1) = 1 + –1 + 1 + –1 = 0.<br>
Vectors in two and three dimensions are orthogonal, in the sense
just defined, if they are at right angles to each other.
For example, in the figure below, the two vectors shown geometrically, (1, 1) and (–1, 1), are at right angles, and have an inner product of 0.
</p>


<p>The <i>length</i> of a vector <b>x</b> is defined to be the square root of
its inner product with itself: &#8730;(<b>x</b> • <b>x</b>). The length of
<b>x</b> is sometimes written as ||<b>x</b>||. As an example,
||(1, –1, 1, –1)|| = &#8730;(1×1 + (–1×–1) + 1×1 + (–1×–1))
= &#8730;4 = 2.
</p>
<p>
In the diagram above, the length of (1, 1) is &#8730;(1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup>) = &#8730;2. This is the same as the length of the line from (0, 0) to (1, 1), calculated using Pythagoras's theorem.
</p>

<p>A vector is said to be <i>normal</i> if it has length 1. So (0.5, –0.5, 0.5, –0.5)
is normal. If <b>x</b> is any vector, then <b>x</b>/||<b>x</b>|| is normal, and
the process of converting <b>x</b> into <b>x</b>/||<b>x</b>|| is called normalisation.
</p>

</a><a name="matrix">
<h3>Matrices</h3>
<p>
A <i>matrix</i> can be thought of as a vector of vectors. Alternatively, you can
think of a matrix as a rectangular array of numbers. <font size="-1">Again, they don't
have to be numbers, but for our purposes they will be.</font> Here is an example of
a matrix:</p>
<p>
[ 1 2 3 4 ]<br>
[ 5 4 3 2 ]<br>
[ 0 1 0 –1 ]
</p>
This is a 3×4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns) - the size of the matrix is 3×4.<br>
As with vectors, matrices of the same size can be added together by adding corresponding
components:

<p>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
[ 1 2 3 4 ]<br>
[ 5 4 3 2 ]<br>
[ 0 1 0 –1 ]
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
[ 7 4 3 0 ]<br>
[ 1 1 1 1 ]<br>
[ 1 0 –1 0 ]
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
[ 8 6 6 4 ]<br>
[ 6 5 4 3 ]<br>
[ 1 1 –1 –1 ]
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>

<p>When <i>matrices</i> are written in symbolic form, they look like this:</p>

<p>
[ <i>a</i><sub>11</sub> <i>a</i><sub>12</sub> <i>a</i><sub>13</sub> <i>a</i><sub>14</sub> ]<br>
[ <i>a</i><sub>21</sub> <i>a</i><sub>22</sub> <i>a</i><sub>23</sub> <i>a</i><sub>24</sub> ]<br>
[ <i>a</i><sub>31</sub> <i>a</i><sub>32</sub> <i>a</i><sub>33</sub> <i>a</i><sub>34</sub> ]
</p>

<p>
Each entry, <i>a<sub>ij</sub></i>, has two subscripts - the first one, <i>i</i> in 
<i>a<sub>ij</sub></i>, indicates which row the entry belongs to, and the second one,
<i>j</i> in <i>a<sub>ij</sub></i>, indicates which column the entry belongs to.
For example, <i>a</i><sub>32</sub> belongs to the third row and second column of the
matrix.
</p>
<p>Matrices as a whole are often symbolised using a capital letter, like <i>A</i>.
So <i>a<sub>ij</sub></i> is the prototypical entry in the matrix <i>A</i>.
If <i>A</i> is an <i>m</i>×<i>n</i> matrix, then we say that <i>m</i> is the
row dimension of the matrix (or just the number of rows) and <i>n</i> is the column
dimension (or number of columns).
</p>

<p>The transpose <i>A<sup>T</sup></i> of a matrix <i>A</i> is obtained by interchanging its
rows and columns. So the transpose of the 3×4 matrix</p><p>
</p><p>
[ 1 2 3 4 ]<br>
[ 5 4 3 2 ]<br>
[ 0 1 0 –1 ]
</p>
<p>is the 4×3 matrix</p>
<p>
[ 1 5 0 ]<br>
[ 2 4 1 ]<br>
[ 3 3 0 ]<br>
[ 4 2 –1 ]
</p>
<p>The transpose of an <i>m</i>×<i>n</i> matrix is an <i>n</i>×<i>m</i> matrix.

</p><p>Notice that a vector with <i>n</i> components can be viewed as a 1×<i>n</i> matrix.
The vectors we used above were <i>row vectors</i>. If you view them as matrices and transpose,
them, you get <i>column vectors</i>. Thus (1, 2, 3, 4) is a row vector, whose transpose is
the column vector</p>

<p>
1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
4
</p>

which, of course, can be viewed as an <i>n</i>×1 matrix.

</a><a name="matrixmult">
<h3>Matrix Multiplication</h3>
<p>
It is sometimes possible to multiply two matrices together. This is done, <b>not</b> by
multiplying corresponding entries together as with matrix addition, but by computing an
inner product for each entry of the product matrix. In general, the product of an
<i>m</i>×<i>n</i> matrix with <i>n</i>×<i>p</i> is an
<i>m</i>×<i>p</i> matrix. Note that for the product of two matrices to exist,
the column dimension of the first matrix (<i>m</i>) must equal the row dimension of
the second matrix. Example (with first matrix 2×3 and second matrix 3×2, so
that the product matrix is 2×2):
</p>
<p>
<table border="0">

[ 1 2 3 ]<br>
[ 5 4 3 ]
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;×&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

[ 3 0 ]<br>
[ 1 1 ]<br>
[ 1 0 ]
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
[ (1, 2, 3) • (3, 1, 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1, 2, 3) • (0, 1, 0) ]<br>
[ (5, 4, 3) • (3, 1, 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5, 4, 3) • (0, 1, 0) ]

[ 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 ]<br>
[ 22&nbsp;4 ]
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>

<p>Notice that it is sometimes possible to multiply a matrix by a vector
(viewed as a matrix). If the matrix is <i>m</i>×<i>n</i> and the
vector has <i>n</i> components, then you can view the vector as a column
vector (<i>n</i>×1 matrix) and multiply them, to get an
<i>m</i>×1 result - a column vector of dimension <i>m</i>:</p>
<p>
<table border="0">

[ 1 2 3 ]<br>
[ 3 4 1 ]<br>
[ 0 1 2 ]

[ 1 ]<br>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
[ (1, 2, 3) • (1, 2, 1) ]<br>
[ (3, 4, 1) • (1, 2, 1) ]<br>
[ (0, 1, 2) • (1, 2, 1) ]

</p>

<p>You could call this post-multiplication by the vector, as the vector
appears post- or after- the matrix. Pre-multiplication by a row vector
is also sometimes possible - an <i>m</i>-dimensional row vector (i.e. an
1×<i>m</i> matrix) can be multiplied by an <i>m</i>×<i>n</i>
matrix to give a 1×<i>n</i> result - another row vector, but of
dimension <i>n</i>.
</p>

</a><a name="hyperplane">
<h3>Hyperplanes</h3>

<p>A hyperplane is a higher-dimensional analogue of a plane in 3-dimensional
space. The general equation of a plane in 3-space is</p>

<p align="center"><i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> + <i>cz</i> = <i>d</i></p>

<p>where <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> are variables
and <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are constants.
That is, the plane is the set of all points (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
<i>z</i>) such that <i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> + <i>cz</i> = <i>d</i> holds.</p>

<p>Thinking in a vector and inner-product sort of way, you can rewrite the
equation of a plane in 3-space as </p>

<p align="center">(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) • (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>)
= <i>d</i></p>

<p>If we write <b>a</b> for (a, b, c) and <b>x</b> for (x, y, z), the equation
becomes</p>

<p align="center"><b>a</b> • <b>x</b> = <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>Note that any (but not all) of <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>
can be zero. So examples of equations of planes are:</p>

<blockquote>
a) 2<i>x</i> + 3<i>y</i> + 4<i>z</i> = 5<br>
b) <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 3<br>
c) <i>y</i> + <i>z</i> = 7<br>
d) <i>x</i> + 3<i>z</i> = 4<br>
e) <i>x</i> = 2<br>
f) <i>y</i> = 1<br>
g) <i>z</i> = 43.2
</blockquote>

<p>So, a plane is a hyperplane in 3-space. Similarly, a line is a hyperplane
in 2-space, and it has an general equation of the form
<b>a</b>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<b>x</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>d</i>,
where this time, <b>a</b> = (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), and
<b>x</b> = (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>). Notice that equations (b)-(g), above,
are equations of planes in 3-space, but also are equations of lines in
2-space. How can this be? Consider (b): <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 3.
In 2-space, this is the set of all points (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)
such that the equation holds. In 3-space, it is the set of all points
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) such that the equation holds - i.e.
<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 3, and <i>z</i> can have any value at all.
Similarly, with (e), in 2-space, this is the line consisting
of all points (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) such that <i>x</i> = 2, and <i>y</i>
can have any value at all, and in 3-space, it is the line consisting
of all points (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) such that <i>x</i> = 2, and
<i>y</i> and <i>z</i> can have any value at all.</p>

<p>In the case of a line in 2-space, the line is one-dimensional, and 2-space
is of course 2-dimensional. For a plane in 3-space, the plane is 2-dimensional
and 3-space is 3-dimensional. In general, in an <i>n</i>-dimensional space,
(i.e. a space of vectors with <i>n</i> components), a hyperplane is a
(<i>n</i>–1)-dimensional object. As before, its general equation is of the
form:</p>

<p align="center"><b>a</b>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<b>x</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>d</i></p>

<p>but this time <b>a</b> and <b>x</b> are <i>n</i>-dimensional vectors.
So <b>a</b> =
(<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>a<sub>n</sub></i>)
and <b>x</b> =
(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>).
</p>

<p>In the case of a line in 2-space, (<i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> = <i>d</i>)
it is easy to check that for a point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) <i>not</i> on
the line, which side of the line the point is on is determined by
whether <i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> – <i>d</i> is positive or negative.
For example, with the line <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 1, the point
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = (0, 0)
is to the left of the line, and <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> – 1 = –1 is negative,
while the point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = (1, 1) is to the right of the line
and  <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> – 1 = +1 is positive.</p>

<p>You can check this for planes in 3-space, too, with a little more
difficulty. It holds in general: for a point <b>x</b> in <i>n</i>-space,
the point lies on one "side" of the hyperplane if
<b>a</b>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<b>x</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<i>d</i>
is negative, and on the other side if 
<b>a</b>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<b>x</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<i>d</i> is positive.</p>

</a><a name="eigen">
<h3>Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues</h3>

<p>When you pre-multiply a column vector <b>x</b> by a matrix A:
<b>x</b> &#8594; A<b>x</b>,
you transform the vector to another vector. Let us consider a particular matrix
A. For some vectors <b>x</b>, A<b>x</b> will be a multiple of <b>x</b>. For
example, if <b>x</b> = (0, 1, 0)<sup><font size="-1">T</font></sup>, and A =<br>
[2, 0, 0]<br>
[0, 7, 0]<br>
[0, 0, 3]<br>
then it is easy to check that A<b>x</b> = 7<b>x</b>.</p>
<p>In such a case we say that <b>x</b> is an <b>eigenvector</b> of A, and
the multiple, in this case 7, is an <b>eigenvalue</b> of A. Thus if
A<b>x</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#955;<b>x</b>, <b>x</b> is the eigenvector, and
&#955; is the eigenvalue.
</p>
<p>A matrix can have several eigenvalues (and hence several eigenvectors).
For example, our example matrix A has three eigenvalues: 2, 7, and 3.
