**estimator of µ** ==TODO:[research]==
For a constant mean model, the estimator of µ is
- ✅◀️ sample mean
~~- ❌ variance of the sample mean.~~
~~- ❌ standard deviation of the sample mean.~~
~~- ❌ population mean divided by the sample size.~~

- ✅ BoxCox is also referred as power transformations. ==TODO:[research]==

- ✅ An ARIMA(p, 1, q) model estimated on a series of logs of prices is equivalent  ==TODO:[research]==
==[RESEARCH **ARCH(q) and GARCH(1,1) models?**, didn't know it]==

diff once loose a lag

AR(2) is 2 lags
lag 2 is 2nd position on x axis
