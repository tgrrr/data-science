Module 9: Introduction
Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 9: In this module, we will study a specific class of model called Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to account for changing variance in the series. Changing variance or volatility clustering problem is mostly seen in econometric time series and GARCH models are frequently used to deal with this problem. We will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of GARCH models and improve your skillsets for the implementation of time series analysis methods.

Links to the learning objectives

This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives ....:

1. Present time series in an informative way, both graphically and with summary statistics
2. Develop stationary and non-stationary, and seasonal and non-seasonal time series models
4. Prepare both oral and written reports to present results of time series analyses 
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to work on Final Project.
