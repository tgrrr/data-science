Module 9: Tasks
Models for Heteroscedasticity
Working in small groups or pairs, complete the following exercises.

Load the Google stock data from August 1, 2014 to September 13, 2006 from the google dataset stored on the TSA package into the workspace of R (Cryer and Chan, 2008, p. 317). Do the following tasks over the landings series;
Display and interpret the time series plot for these data.
Display and interpret McLeod-Li test on this series.
Specify a set of ARC/GARCH models to for this series.
Find parameter estimates.
Do the residual analysis.
Construct 95% prediction intervals for 10-step-ahead forecasts.
 

Load the Lg wave seismic data from an earthquake known as the Massachusetts Mountain Earthquake (August 5, 1971) from the mm.eq dataset stored on the tswge package into the workspace of R (Woodward et al., 2017, p. 201). Do the following tasks over the landings series;
Display and interpret the time series plot for these data.
Display and interpret McLeod-Li test on this series.
Specify a set of ARC/GARCH models to for this series.
Find parameter estimates.
Do the residual analysis.
Could you identify a GARCH model that sufficiently fits to this series?
Fit an ARMA+GARCH model to this series.
Has the ARMA+GARCH approach improved the model fit to this series?
