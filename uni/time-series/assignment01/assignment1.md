# Assignment 1

The dataset represents:
- thickness of Ozone layer 1927 to 2016 in Dobson units (yearly changes)
- A negative value in the dataset represents a decrease in Ozone thickness
- A positive value represents an Ozone increase in the thickness

You will work independently on this assignment. 
- Your task is to analyze the data by using the analysis methods covered in the first two modules of MATH1318 Time Series Analysis course in this semester. 
- Your final goal is to find the best fitting trend model to this dataset and give predictions of yearly changes for the next 5 years.

## Instructions
The dataset you will analyse in this assignment represents yearly changes in the thickness of Ozone layer 1927 to 2016 in Dobson units. A negative value in the dataset represents a decrease in the thickness and a positive value represents an increase in the thickness.

You will work independently on this assignment. Your task is to analyze the data by using the analysis methods covered in the first two modules of MATH1318 Time Series Analysis course in this semester. Your final goal is to find the best fitting trend model to this dataset and give predictions of yearly changes for the next 5 years.

The ozone thickness series is given by “dataset1.csv” file is available herePreview the document.

In this task, it is expected that you ask yourself what are the elements of a suitable and successful data analysis, and how you might go about presenting your results in a written report format. Please review the contents of the first two modules and apply suitable approaches here. The rubric given below will guide you through the my expectations in terms of reporting, R codes, descriptive analysis, modelling, and diagnostic checking.

Submission Instructions:
All reports must be submitted via the Turnitin.
Your submission should be uploaded as a PDF or Microsoft Word file.
Your report should meet with English language requirements.
Late submissions will be marked in accordance with the late submission policy explained under “Assessment” title of the course information page.
Collaboration vs. Collusion and Plagiarism:
You are free to discuss main aspects of the assignment with your classmates. However, keep in mind that this is an individual assignment and you should demonstrate your own effort and understanding. Because assignments will be submitted through Turnitin, all the material you submitted will be checked for plagiarism. If plagiarism is detected, both the copier and the student copied from will be responsible. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure you do not copy or do not allow other classmates to copy your work. You should ensure you understand your responsibilities by reading the RMIT University website on academic integrity (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..
