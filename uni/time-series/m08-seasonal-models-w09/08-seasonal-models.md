Module 8: Introduction
Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 8: We will introduce seasonality into the ARIMA modelling methodology in this module. When we have quarterly, monthly or more frequently observed series, most probably we will have seasonality in our series. To deal with seasonality, we will focus on Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models. In SARIMA models, we have another bunch of seasonal order to specify in the model specification phase. We will discuss specification or ordinary and seasonal orders and parameter estimation for SARIMA models. Then, we will go on with a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of specification of SARIMA models and improve your skillsets for the implementation of time series analysis methods.

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Present time series in an informative way, both graphically and with summary statistics
2. Develop stationary and non-stationary, and seasonal and non-seasonal time series models
4. Prepare both oral and written reports to present results of time series analyses
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to begin work on Final project.
