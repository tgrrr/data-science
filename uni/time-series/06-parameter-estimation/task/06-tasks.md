Module 6: Tasks
Parameter estimation

Working in small groups or pairs, complete the following exercises.

1. The dataset given in “earnings.Preview the documentcsv” file contains average weekly earnings (AUD) in Australia on each November between 1994 and 2016. This dataset is available through http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6302.0Nov%202016?OpenDocument#Time (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. webpage. Load the dataset, convert it into a ts object and do the following tasks:

Conduct a hypothesis test to decide on the existence of a trend in this series.
Overcome the nonstationary nature of this series by using suitable tools.
Specify the orders of ARIMA(p,d,q) model by using
ACF and PACF plots
EACF plot
BIC table
Estimate the model parameters using at least two approaches and select the best model based on AIC and BIC.
2. The dataset given in “data.cash.Preview the documentcsv” file contains yearly averages of monthly total values of ATM cash withdrawals ($ million) in Australia between 1994 and 2016. This dataset is available through http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/#interest-rates (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. webpage. Load the dataset, convert it into a ts object and do the following tasks:

Conduct a hypothesis test to decide on the existence of a trend in this series.
Overcome the nonstationary nature of this series by using suitable tools.
Specify the orders of ARIMA(p,d,q) model by using
ACF and PACF plots
EACF plot
BIC table
Estimate the model parameters using at least two approaches and select the best model based on AIC and BIC.
3. Load the simulated dataset “data.sim” available in "data.sim.Preview the documentcsv” file and convert it into a ts object and do the following tasks:

Conduct a hypothesis test to decide on the existence of a trend in this series.
Overcome the nonstationary nature of this series by using suitable tools.
Specify the orders of ARIMA(p,d,q) model by using
ACF and PACF plots
EACF plot
BIC table
Estimate the model parameters using at least two approaches and select the best model based on AIC and BIC.
