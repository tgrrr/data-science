Module 7: Introduction
Introduction to the week
Welcome to Week 7: Statistical models are mostly based on certain assumption like the famous normality assumption. Diagnostic checkin is an important step in modelling time series data. We need to make sure that our fitted model is suitable for further use like forecasting new occurrences the series of interest. We will focus on basic statistical tests and visualisations for diagnostic checking in this module. Then, we will have a hands-on task session to deepen your understanding of diagnostic checking and improve your skillsets for the implementation of time series analysis methods as a whole. 

Links to the learning objectives
This week will contribute to Course Learning Objectives:

1. Present time series in an informative way, both graphically and with summary statistics
3. Estimate model parameters and compare different models developed for the same dataset in terms of their estimation and prediction accuracy
Purpose
By completing the essential set text reading and reviewing the recorded lecture, followed by completing your self-check to ensure you have understood the key concepts, you will be able to work on Assignment 2 and Final Project.
