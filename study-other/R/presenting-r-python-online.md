# Hosting R and Python online

## R
 
- [r notebook]
- [bokeh]
- [rdrr]
- [r api for reactjs integration]
- [rnotebook] - should offer live coding, but doesn't have every library.

- [depreciated: jupyterlab-google-drive] - looked good, but google depreciated the ability to use it to sync

## Python

- [Jupyter viewer] - official
- [embedding Jupyter]
